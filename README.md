# About the Project:

This project aims to predict sales based on advertising expenditures using the Advertising Dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset contains information about advertising expenditures on three different media channels: TV, radio, and newspaper, along with corresponding sales figures. By analyzing the relationship between advertising expenditures and sales, the goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast sales based on future advertising investments.
